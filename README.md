# Johnny's Website

## About

This project is made to act as a personal website for [jgoold.me](https://jgoold.me) / [johnnygjohnny.co.uk](https://johnnygjohnny.co.uk)  
This is my first web project ever, so it is going to be bad. But maybe one day it will be good, who knows.

The website is currently deployed using [Coolify](https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify), which has made the whole process of deploying this website, and other personal projects, a whole lot easier. Commits to the master branch are automatically deployed onto the website, so it should always be up to date with what is on here!
